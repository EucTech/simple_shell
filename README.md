This is the simple shell program
In this program, we are writing a UNIX command line interpreter which will:
Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command
Handle command lines with arguments
Handle the PATH
Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
Write our own getline function
handle arguments for the built-in exit
Not use strtok
Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands
Implement the builtin command cd
Handle the commands separator ;
Handle the && and || shell logical operators
Implement the alias builtin command
Handle variables replacement
Handle comments (#)
And handle a file as input
